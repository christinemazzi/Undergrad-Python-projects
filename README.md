# Bellow are the descriptions of each project respectively
# PROJECT 1: 
In this midterm project, I filtered and aggregated data, generating time-series plots for poverty trends by country, and dynamically visualizing global poverty changes through dropdown menus

# PROJECT 2:
In this project, I analyzed climate data,leveraging NumPy for statistical calculations and Matplotlib for visualizations. I worked on tasks like computing observed and simulated statistics, performing hypothesis testing with p-values, and creating histograms to compare distributions, all to study precipitation patterns during drought and non-drought years.

# PROJECT 3: 
In this project, I analyzed population and poverty data, generating time-series plots for different countries, and dynamically visualizing changes in poverty levels across various regions
